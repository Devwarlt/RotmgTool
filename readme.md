RotMG Tool
==========
A simple tool for your daily RotMG game

Features
--------
See changelog.txt for details

Usage
-----
For Windows users, just double click it and run! (Require .NET Framework 4.0)

For Linux/Mac users, you need to install Mono. I tested on Ubuntu and 
`apt-get install mono-complete` can install all dependencies.

You'll also need to run `mozroots --import --sync` to ensure proper HTTPS 
connection.

Remember to run as administrator/sudo!
